- language data is from common voice in mp3 which is then converted into wav:https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets

- dialect data is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murtadhayaseen/arabic-spoken-regional-archive-sara 

- I provided the smallest set which is 47 recordings per dialect 3 seconds each. I can send my other configurations of data through google drive.
